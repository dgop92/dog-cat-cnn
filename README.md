# Binary Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network for Cats and Dogs

This project serves as a foundation for learning how to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) and how to structure an ML project for reproducibility and maintainability.

## Motivation

The primary focus of this project is to understand the project structure rather than achieving high accuracy in the model's predictions.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained knowledge in the following areas:

- Creating a simple data pipeline using Python scripts and Makefiles for orchestration.
- Training a CNN model, saving it to disk, and loading it for predictions.
- Working with hdf5 files.
- Training the model by loading data from disk. Although the project's data comfortably fit into memory, I incorporated the flexibility to train the model in parts.

## How to Use

To explore and execute the scripts, you can access the provided Google Colab notebook using the following link:
